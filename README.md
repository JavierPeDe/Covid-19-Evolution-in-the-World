# Covid-19-Evolution-in-the-World
Covid-19-Evolution-in-the-World is a covid-19 tracker which displays the infected, recovered and fatalities of the country selected by the user. There's also an **About page** with information from **official sources** and **warnings**, which you should check before using our tracker. Our charts have modal windows to make them bigger and more visible. We have included a dark mode theme. You can toggle between light and dark mode by clicking the button on the right side of the NavBar.
